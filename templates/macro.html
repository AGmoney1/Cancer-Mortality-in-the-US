    <center> <p class="about_title">Interpretations: </p>
      <p id="macro_text">Starting at 549,829 in 1999 the total amount of deaths by cancer has increased 9.12% to 602,347 deaths in 2020.  
        The number of deaths due to the four most common cancers has remained relatively constant, while all the other cancers collectively have increased 
        at a greater rate, contributing to the overall increase. Colon and rectum cancer causes the greatest number of deaths each year. 
        Prostate, female breast, lung and bronchus, and colon and rectum cancer are the four most common cancers, and they cause about 50% of cancer deaths.
      </p>

    <center <p class="about_title">Key Takeaways: </p>
      <p id="macro_text"> 1. While the number of deaths in the United States from 1999 to 2020 has increased approximately 41% since 1999, cancer deaths overall have only increased about 9%. 
        This shows that the amount of cancer deaths relative to the the total amount of deaths has decreased. It is important to note that in 2020, COVID-19 caused a spike in deaths, possibly
        leading to data distortions.
      </p>
      <p id="macro_text"> 2. Despite making up only 4 of the 200+ types of cancer, prostate, female breast, lung and bronchus, and colon and rectum cancer are the 4 most
        diagnosed cancers and 4 of the deadliest cancers. Although they have remained as the 4 most commonly diagnosed cancers, the deaths caused by the other 200+ cancers
        are the main reason behind the overall increase in deaths by cancer since 1999.
      </p>
      <p id="macro_text"> 3. States in the Northeast tend to have a higher percentage of deaths by cancer out of total deaths than the American average, 
        while states in the West tend to have a lower percentage than the national average.
